  4. Prescription section mimics a real doctorâ€™s pad layout

  5. Search and filter options for patient management

Methodology:

ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling & Normalization

  1. Structured using 3rd Normal Form (3NF)

  3. Modeled using dbdiagram.io

ðŸ”¹ Data Population

  Seeded with sample records for:

  1. 5 patients

  2. 3 doctors

  3. Medicines and prescription info

  4. Bill amounts and payment status

ðŸ”¹ SQL Backend (SQLite)

Use Case:

A hospital administrator wants to view all patients with pending bills under Dr. Smith. They can filter patients on the dashboard using the dropdown and instantly view the matching data. They can also print prescriptions or generate bills using the quick action buttons.
